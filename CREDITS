   JOS
   ---

   The JOS kernel was originally developed for the Operating Systems
   Engineering class at MIT, with subsequent development for that class and
   for Advanced Operating Systems and Advanced Operating Systems
   Engineering classes at UCLA, NYU, and Stanford.  This kernel uses ideas
   and some code from Xok, an x86 implementation of the exokernel
   architecture; Xok was originally developed by David Mazieres in Frans
   Kaashoek's group at MIT.

   JOS is dedicated to the memory of Josh Cates.
